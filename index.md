## Hi!! Welcome to my website, here is a little about me :)!
I'm Ivette, A 3rd year Computer Engineering major at the University of Arkansas with a minor in Finance. I enjoy running in the mornings before my coffee run. I love studying where there is sunlight as it makes me feel good and energetic. 

# Projects

Here are some of the projects I’ve worked on:

- **[mainp4.cpp](https://github.com/Ivette174/Ivette174.github.io/blob/main/mainp4.cpp)** – This projects goal was to gain experience implementing and using sorted linked lists to do text analysis. This specific code is made to read a text tile and estimate the reading level of the book by counting the number of unique words it contains.
- **[Other Project](https://github.com/Ivette174/YourOtherProject)** – A link to another project repository or file, along with a brief description.
