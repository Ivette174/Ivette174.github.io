## Hi!! Welcome to my website, here is a little about me :)!
Hi, I’m Ivette! I’m a third-year Computer Engineering major at the University of Arkansas, minoring in Finance. My passion lies in bridging technology and financial insights, and I’m actively pursuing opportunities in software development and engineering to bring my skills to real-world applications.

Beyond academics, I’m a morning runner and coffee enthusiast, finding energy in my routines and inspiration in sunlit study spaces. These habits drive my focus and bring a fresh perspective to my work, whether I’m diving into code, analyzing data, or optimizing financial strategies. My blend of technical expertise and analytical skills in finance equips me with a unique foundation for roles in engineering and technology.

I’m eager to contribute to innovative teams where I can continue learning, problem-solving, and making an impact.
# Projects

Here are some of the projects I’ve worked on:

## C++ 
from newest to oldest

- **[Priority Queue Implementation with Dual Priority Levels](https://github.com/Ivette174/queue_project)** – Designed and implemented a priority queue in C++ with dual priority levels (high and low) for customer management. The queue prioritizes high-priority customers, allowing them to "jump the line" ahead of low-priority customers. Includes functions for insertion, removal, checking queue status, and printing, with performance tested through multiple queue operations.


- **[Recursive Binary Search and Unique Word Analysis](https://github.com/Ivette174/Ivette174.github.io/blob/main/mainp4.cpp)** – This projects goal was to gain experience implementing and using sorted linked lists to do text analysis. This specific code is made to read a text tile and estimate the reading level of the book by counting the number of unique words it contains.
