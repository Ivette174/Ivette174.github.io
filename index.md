## Hi!! Welcome to my website, here is a little about me :)!
I'm Ivette, A 3rd year Computer Engineering major at the University of Arkansas with a minor in Finance. I enjoy running in the mornings before my coffee run. I love studying where there is sunlight as it makes me feel good and energetic.
